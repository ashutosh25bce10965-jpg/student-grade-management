# **Statement of Purpose**

This project, **Student Grades Management System**, was developed as a simple console-based application in Python to demonstrate fundamental programming concepts such as data structures, functions, and user interaction through menus.

The primary objective of this project is to provide a basic yet functional system for managing student records. Users can add, update, delete, and view student grades using a user-friendly text-based interface. The system stores the student data in a Python dictionary, allowing efficient manipulation and retrieval of information.

This project serves as a practical exercise for:

* Understanding dictionary-based data storage
* Implementing CRUD operations
* Working with loops and conditional statements
* Designing clear function-based program architecture
* Applying simple input/output interactions

By completing this project, I aimed to strengthen foundational Python skills and create a working example of a small but useful management system. This application can be expanded with additional features such as data persistence, validation, sorting, or a graphical interface in the future.
